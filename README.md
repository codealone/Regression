# Regression

Welcome to Regression, the second course in the University of Washington Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera! 
By joining this course, you’ve taken another step in becoming a machine learning expert.

Regression is one of the most important and broadly used machine learning and statistics tools out there. It allows you to 
make predictions from data by learning the relationship between features of your data and some observed, continuous-valued 
response. Regression is used in a massive number of applications ranging from predicting stock prices to understanding gene
regulatory networks.

Review the material we’ll cover each week, and preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course.
These assignments will give you hands-on experience in fundamental regression concepts,including implementing and applying
regression algorithms to real-world data. In particular, the topics covered include:

Simple linear regression

Multiple regression

Assessing performance

Ridge regression

Feature selection & Lasso

Nearest neighbor & kernel regression

You will also become familiar with and implement fundamental techniques that are core to all of machine learning, beyond
regression, such as cross validation, bias-variance tradeoff, gradient descent and coordinate descent.

We provide starter code for all assignments using IPython Notebooks for an interactive experience, but you are welcome to use
other tools in this course.
